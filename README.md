# Average-Station-Usage-CTA-Python
Used Public Database of Cta Trains to see how often Stations are used on a daily and monthly basis. 
While I was not able to upload the Database you can find the one I used by going to https://www.transitchicago.com/data/ and downloading the Ridership - 'L' Station Entries - Daily Totals
